Albert’s Notes:

  - changes to punctuation “; vs ,”, use of dashes, spacing of
    paragraphs so that the difference highlighter aligns
  - Had to split the articles
  - clause numbers removed, took liberty with spacing and line breaks to
    highlihght only interesting differences
  - word-smithing
  - Left the preambles and 2nd amendment untouched
  - all lower case. I’m sure something is lost, but what can you do?
  - American spelling vs british spelling. behavior, labour, defense
  - What stays the same
  - confederate constitution used the oxford comma. I removed them
  - I left dashes between words, but not ages
  - I added \[amendment\_i\]. Amendements are part of the constitution;
    to ignore them would be to ignore the state of the constitution on
    1861-XX-XX
  - Amendments ix and x inserted into article vi
  - added to article vi in the original constitution
  - 11th and 12th amendment
  - Article v section header removed
