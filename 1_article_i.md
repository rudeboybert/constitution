all legislative powers herein delegated shall be vested in a congress of the confederate states, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.

## section 2

the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states,
and the electors in each state shall be citizens of the confederate states; and have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature; but no person of foreign birth, not a citizen of the confederate states, shall be allowed to vote for any officer, civil or political, state or federal.

no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained the age of twenty five years, and be a citizen of the confederate states, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.

representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within this confederacy,
according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding indians not taxed, 
three fifths of all slaves.
the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the congress of the confederate states, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every fifty thousand,
but each state shall have at least one representative;
and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of south carolina shall be entitled to choose six, the state of georgia ten, the state of alabama nine, the state of florida two, the state of mississippi seven, the state of louisiana six, and the state of texas six.

when vacancies happen in the representation from any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.

the house of representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers;
and shall have the sole power of impeachment; except that any judicial or other federal officer, resident and acting solely within the limits of any state, may be impeached by a vote of two thirds of both branches of the legislature thereof.

## section 3

the senate of the confederate states shall be composed of two senators from each state, chosen for six years by the legislature thereof, at the regular session next immediately preceding the commencement of the term of service;
and each senator shall have one vote.

immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes. the seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one third may be chosen every second year; and if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.

no person shall be a senator who shall not have attained the age of thirty years, and be a citizen of the confederate states, and who shall not, then elected, be an inhabitant of the state for which he shall be chosen.

the vice president of the confederate states shall be president of the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.

the senate shall choose their other officers, and also a president pro tempore, in the absence of the vice president, or when he shall exercise the office of president of the confederate states.

the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. when sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. when the president of the confederate states is tried, the chief justice shall preside: and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.

judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust or profit under the confederate states: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.

## section 4

the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; subject to the provisions of this constitution; but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the times and places of choosing senators.

the congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first monday in december, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.

## section 5

each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each house may provide.

each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds of the whole number, expel a member.

each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.

neither house, during the session of congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.

## section 6

the senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the confederate states. they shall in all cases, except treason, felony and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.

no senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the confederate states, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the confederate states,
shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.
but congress may, by law, grant to the principal officer in each of the executive departments a seat upon the floor of either house, with the privilege of discussing any measures appertaining to his department.

## section 7

all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives; but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.

every bill which shall have passed both houses, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the confederate states: if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. if after such reconsideration two thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that house, it shall become a law. but in all such cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively. if any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days (sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.
the president may approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill. in such case he shall, in signing the bill, designate the appropriations disapproved; and shall return a copy of such appropriations, with his objections, to the house in which the bill shall have originated; and the same proceedings shall then be had as in case of other bills disapproved by the president.

every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of both houses may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the president of the confederate states; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of both houses, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in case of a bill.

## section 8

the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,
imposts, and excises for revenue, necessary to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and carry on the government of the confederate states; but no bounties shall be granted from the treasury; nor shall any duties or taxes on importations from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry; and all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the confederate states;

to borrow money on the credit of the confederate states;

to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the indian tribes;

to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of one or more states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of the government of the confederate states, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,
dockyards, and other needful buildings; and

to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the confederate states, or in any department or officer thereof.
