Albert's Notes:

* changes to punctuation "; vs ,", use of dashes, spacing of paragraphs so that the difference highlighter aligns
* Had to split the articles
* clause numbers removed, took liberty with spacing and line breaks to highlihght only interesting differences
* word-smithing
* Left the preambles and 2nd amendment untouched
* all lower case. I'm sure something is lost, but what can you do?
* American spelling vs british spelling. behavior, labour, defense
* What stays the same
* confederate constitution used the oxford comma. I removed them
* I left dashes between words, but not ages
* I added [amendment_i]. Amendements are part of the constitution; to ignore them would be to ignore the state of the constitution on 1861-XX-XX
* Amendments ix and x inserted into article vi
* added to article vi in the original constitution 
* 11th and 12th amendment
* Article v section header removed
