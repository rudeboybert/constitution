the executive power shall be vested in a president of the confederate states of america. he and the vice president shall hold their offices for the term of six years; but the president shall not be reeligible. the president and vice president shall be elected as follows:

each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress: but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the confederate states,
shall be appointed an elector.

the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for president and vice president, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as president, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as vice president, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as president, and of all persons voted for as vice president,
and of the number of votes for each;
which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed, to the seat of the government of the confederate states, directed to the president of the senate. the president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.

the person having the greatest number of votes for president shall be the president,
if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed;
and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding three, on the list of those voted for as president, the house of representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the president.
but in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states,
the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.
and if the house of representatives shall not choose a president, whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the 4th day of march next following, then the vice president shall act as president, as in case of the death, or other constitutional disability of the president.

the person having the greatest number of votes as vice president shall be the vice president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if no person have a majority, then, from the two highest numbers on the list, the senate shall choose the vice president; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. but no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice president of the confederate states.

the congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes;
which day shall be the same throughout the confederate states.

no person except a natural-born citizen of the confederate states, or a citizen thereof,
at the time of the adoption of this constitution,
or a citizen thereof born in the united states prior to the 20th of december, 1860, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the limits of the confederate states, as they may exist at the time of his election.

in case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on the vice president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the president and vice president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected.

the president shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the confederate states, or any of them.

before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:
"i do solemnly swear (or affirm) that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the confederate states, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution thereof."

and all other officers of the confederate states, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law: but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.

the principal officer in each of the executive departments, and all persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be removed from office at the pleasure of the president. all other civil officers of the executive departments may be removed at any time by the president, or other appointing power, when their services are unnecessary, or for dishonesty, incapacity. inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty; and when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the senate, together with the reasons therefor.
