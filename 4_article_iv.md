## section 2

the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any state of this confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.

a person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime against the laws of such state, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.

no slave or other person held to service or labor in any state or territory of the confederate states, under the laws thereof, escaping or lawfully carried into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such slave belongs, or to whom such service or labor may be due.

## section 3

other states may be admitted into this confederacy by a vote of two-thirds of the whole house of representatives and two-thirds of the senate, the senate voting by states; but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress.

the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations concerning the property of the confederate states, including the lands thereof.

the confederate states may acquire new territory; and congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the confederate states, lying without the limits of the several sates; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the confederacy. in all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the confederate states, shall be recognized and protected be congress and by the territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several confederate states and territories shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the confederate states.
